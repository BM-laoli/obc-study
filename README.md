# Introduction
>
> This is a study manual for 📚 the Objective-C program, with all the code and practical examples. I hope it will be helpful for you who are new to iOS development

## Highlights

1. **All examples** included
2. Contains part of the basic syntax of C language, after learning it it will no longer be difficult to see C language
3. Notes summarize and organize many knowledge points, suitable for quick review and secondary supplementary review

## Suitable for the crowd
>
> Suitable for students at every stage (more inclined to students who are just starting out, although it is 2023 But OC still has to be learned, there is no systematic OC book on the market, but this one I recommend very, very much

# Chapter Table of Contents

> Go to document ./doc/keywords.md

# Note ⚠️ the problem of file directory
>
> Since the projects created by Xcode are sub-git projects, after deleting its git, there is only one soft link left in the outer layer, which is not what we want, so I synced every change to src Please refer to the code here.
